So, most of my work [is open-source][my-github]. Actually all of it is
in some git repositories, but there is one which I keep secret (my
playground, dubbed *kindergarten*). But yes, I should publish the ones I
haven't uploaded yet.

 * [Adventures in Space](https://github.com/heyLu/adventures_in_space) -
    a (mostly) physically correct energy-based space shooter
 * dimplegen (not yet published) - a street-generating python script
 * [delicious](https://github.com/heyLu/delicious) - a *\*cough\** testing library
 * [gem-scope](https://github.com/heyLu/gem-scope) - a RubyGems plugin
    that manages sets of gems (doesn't work anymore as of early 2012)
 * circlish - a SVG-based presentation tool using funny bubbles
