So far I've only written very small patches and worked on my own stuff.
But there are some commits in [haskell-gi][] and [jark-client][] which I
wrote (yay! :).

Next up, something bigger (hopefully)!

[haskell-gi]: http://git.rhydd.org/?p=haskell-gi;a=summary
[jark-client]: https://github.com/icylisper/jark-client
